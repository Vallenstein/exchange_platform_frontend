        <h3>Our Goals with this service</h3>
        <p class="lorem">
          This platform provides an exchange platform for all univiersities using the iLab courses.
          With this service we support the exchange of ideas of all univiersities taking part.
          We also ensure quality, by giving the option of student feedback.
          This page includes a survey which each student can fill out after a module.
          This way instructors can see how well their materials come accross.
          See the FAQs for how to use the survey.
        </p>
        <p class="lorem">
          We also track anonymized data of how long labs take and what the average points are.
          This provides an overview of the dfficulty and time effort for students.
